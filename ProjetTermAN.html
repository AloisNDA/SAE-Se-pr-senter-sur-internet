            Our project was to create an automatic timing station. 
            The station must be able to start by itself, to recharge by itself and to be easily configured, it must be able to resist of weather conditions.

            At first I and my team had to define the appropriate means of communication for a maximum distance of 500m with potential obstacles between point A and B.
            At the same time we had to find out how to automatically recharge.
            Then at the end how to make it easy to use and resistant od wheater cinditions.

            For the automatic triggering several solutions were viable so we took the most optimal one if we took into account the fact that several people could pass by at the same time. <b>The laser sensor</b>.
            The means of communication that we chose is the <b>radio transmission</b>.
            For the automatic recharging we opted for the <b>solar panel</b> and the <b>battery</b>.
            For the configuration of the tool, a simple <b>LCD screen</b> that we would configure with different interfaces.

            The project did not succed beacause of time and resources but the solutions and mathematical thinking were done.
